## Project Summary



## Problem Statement

Batteries are ubiquitious in our daily lives. We tend to use many battery powered electrical devices especially when we are at outdoors during camping, vacations and hiking. Besides that, the Internet of Things (IoT) which is gaining more popularity in all sort of sectors requires small DC supplies to power the sensors and the microcontrollers. Typically, batteries are used to supply electricity for the IoT devices. When these electrical devices run out of battery charge, we need a suitable power source to charge the battery. The power supply should meet the criteria of being portable and self-generated so that it is usable for both charging small electical devices and powering up IoT devices. Hence, in this situation, a solar powered charging system will be developed in this project. 

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are listed as follows: -

(i) To develop a solar powered charging system with a battery storage system. 
(ii) To evaluate the performance of solar powered charging system in terms of the efficiency, charging and discharging time of the internal battery in response to electrical loads.
